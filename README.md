Predicting crime in San Francisco
=================================
![Kaggle](./img/kaggle.png)

> ### Predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay
> From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's
> most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.  Today, the
> city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising
> wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital
> toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the
> bay.  From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset
> provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's
> neighborhoods. Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime
> that occurred.
